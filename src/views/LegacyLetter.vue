						Subject: Attn: Kirk Kerkorian / Forward Requested / The Theorem: A Complete Answer to Human Behavior To:
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						Dear Mr. Kirk Kerkorian
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						I am standing where you once were. I am you of ten or twenty years ago---yet I am sitting next to you right now--my heart pounding out of my chest, wondering what you are going to do next.
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						So, I will introduce myself; my name is Douglas Arone and I am a published author--and quite by chance, a behavioral theorist. My book was published in 2006 in the UK by a British Publisher--though I am an American, The Theorem: A Complete Answer to Human Behavior ( I have retained rights). The book chronicles a major discovery--perhaps one of the largest in the field of human psychology that I stumbled on by complete accident over twenty years ago. Now you may have heard of the book--though it is not probable. This of course is why I am writing to you-the you that you were twenty years ago--with only a dream in your pocket; under a dark threatening sky.
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						While I know it is unorthodox for an author to write you asking for funding-- I am certainly not an orthodox author and this is most certainly a very unorthodox discovery and book. But then I am not looking for any man either--but a remarkable man--a great man. I was told that this may very well be you; we will see. In return for a couple minutes of your time--I will take you on a journey that I am certain you will never forget. It is most certainly a journey that not everyone will get a chance to go on--you however have earned the right by default of your success.
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						This journey will take at least 10 minutes of your time--so please only scroll down and read this letter when you are relaxed--perhaps at the end of the day. This may very well change your life and at the very least expand your consciousness. I am asking you of course to trust me here. I think you will enjoy very much what you are about to read. Please note that I have included this on one long letter form as I did not feel you would appreciate opening an attachment. However, if you request, I can also make this letter available to you in a word document -via attachment.

						Letter of Request
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						Thank you for your trust Mr. Kirk Kerkorian,--I will not let you down.
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						Before I fully explain everything to you, let's talk about you for a minute--about your legacy!
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						While most men want to leave something behind when they are gone--for you is it an obsession. There is simply no other reason you work as hard as you do. To say to the Universe, "I was here--I mattered, not only to those I knew, but also to those I never met: In short--a form of immortality.” This is a goal and a driving force motivation for many successful men, but for you it is even more than that. And since I have gained some of your trust, I am going to trust you as well. I am going to explain something to you that you likely have never heard before, though you may have suspected it. When you think deeply about it, immortality is a curse of mankind and especially on man himself. What does this mean? Well, for women it is different as they have immortality flow through them naturally. Through childbirth they experience within them: the entire creation; formation and delivery of life. And if that is not enough, they are eventually reminded of this immortality through their grandchildren. Just watch a grandmother with her grandchildren and you will see that it is more even than love, as it is a selfless concern for the child--their own immortality.
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						Immortality for men however is not so automatic, as our subconscious is not this intuitive. While our surname is carried down through our sons' offspring, and we obviously play a part in the process of reproduction--it is ultimately a woman's moment. No, man has to struggle for recognition after he passes. To be remembered he needs to have a bridge, a university, a foundation or some other icon left in his name. In short; he has to be rich, powerful or both. Indeed it is no coincidence that the vast majority of great works of art and literature are accomplished by men--or women without children. It is not that women do not have this ability, but their quest for immortality is quenched by childbirth. View world history and life around you from this perspective and you will see how accurate this is--essentially this is the story of mankind.
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						In America, men like Rockefeller, Carnegie and Henry Ford are successful examples of those who have obtained this immortality; every year millions roll these names off their tongues, even though these men have long since expired. And while you at this stage of your life are likely very comfortable in your place in this world and have thought about what you are to leave behind, there is still that quenching desire to do more! And let's face it, history can be fickle, and a bit deceptive; bridges are replaced, streets are renamed, and foundations close. Many men go to the grave assured that they will be remembered, and for a short time are--only to be written out of the edit as time marches forward--completely forgotten.
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						Yes, you want more and you want a guarantee that you will be remembered. And let's be honest--you are the type of man who gets what he wants! Yet the more that you have seen of the world, the larger you know it is and the harder you know you have to work to see your impact endure. It seems like every day you must be a gladiator out there slaying the opposition; it seems like an endless birthing machine that infinitely produces challengers and upstarts.
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						What if I could give you something that would shelter and insulate you from that for the rest of your life; something so large and so significant to humanity that your legacy would continue forever and it could never be challenged or overtaken by anyone--ever?
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						Then you could rest at the top, and never feel the need to look behind you in order to see who is there again. Well I will explain how I can ensure you accomplish this, and in terms of dollars and cents which is a way I think you will appreciate. So let’s get started, as we have a good amount of ground to cover:
					</p>
					<p class="px-5 emphasis">
						Call to Action!
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						Now it is your turn... Captains of Industry and philanthropists will spend hundreds of millions of dollars to be remembered for a building, a foundation or a prize, yet with one gift of one-hundredth of that you will be remembered above and beyond them. It is an amazing story really, and you are a part of it. Just like in the business world--even in philanthropy you will trump them!
					</p>
					<p class="px-5 emphasis">
						Here is where you come in...
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						The story itself is inspirational, as so much of it will be written by you--the destiny that is in front of you:
					</p>
					<p class="px-5 emphasis">
						Mankind in the Twenty-first Century is plagued by mental illness; defined by autism, cancer, and so many disorders of behavior that it affected not only productivity, but man's well being in general: Then, and… (This is my small part!)
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						Enter the fumbling, classically trained writer (You will enter the story soon!) working on what he is convinced will be the Great American Novel. Accidentally he stumbles onto the largest discovery in human psychology, perhaps one of the largest discoveries in the history of mankind. Unknown to him lies ahead almost twenty years of obscurity where he lives a Spartan existence while perfecting his find. Plundered by an inept publisher, destined for obscurity he looks into the bleak luminous night and at the end of the dark cavernous enclave, he reaches out! He swallows what little pride he maintains and then.... Enter the hero---enter you!
					</p>
					<p class="px-5 emphasis">
						About The Theorem
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						The best part of the above paragraph is that it is not a story at all. Instead it is a foreshadowing of a series of events that are likely to happen in the near future. And It is up to you as to how fast that near future will occur--essentially from this moment forward you hold the destiny of mankind in your hand. This is happening right now--right here.
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						Here though is where I need you first to transform yourself and your state of mind back--watching the grey hair return to its natural color; wipe away all the years of stress and of hard knocks. I need you in your garage or in that run down office working on the dream that made you the powerful man you are today. I need your boundless optimism to return! I need your strong shoulders to combat all those naysayers that told you it could not be done--saying you were not qualified to envision the very destiny that you have now obtained. I need you this way, because otherwise what I am about to ask you is going to sound more like a science fiction novel than a sincere request for financial endorsement.
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						So here we go: The discovery chronicled in The Theorem: A Complete Answer to Human Behavior is essentially a master key. This master key is the missing link in human behavior and human psychology. With this key every single major psychological and developmental disorder can be easily understood and ultimately prevented; including autism, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, depression, disorders of sleep, panic disorder and much more. This discovery also uncovers the origins of the motivations as to: why we talk, eat, sleep and what attracts us to each other.
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						Here is the catch--and it is a big one. Without The Theorem not a single behavior listed will ever be fully understood. Of more significance, not a single disorder will ever be prevented--not one--not ever. All roads lead through the behavioral model included in The Theorem. This is for the simple reason that it is correct.
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						I understand that this is contrary to the established scientific process of specialization utilized in tackling a disease or condition. But I assure you that this is the very process; this focus on isolating one particular disease, which has historically been so beneficial to mankind--leading to cures of such major life changing diseases such as Polio and Smallpox---is the same process that essentially deserts the researcher as an effective tool when they are in search for a cure to disorders of behavior. In other words, the methods that worked towards curing Malaria, will never work towards understanding and curing anorexia nervosa. In fact the opposite is true, as this specialized method leads the researcher down one wrong road onto another. Now in the business world you have seen these failed archaic approaches that, even against all common logic, certain individuals cling to. They falsely reason that because these methods have helped them succeed in the past, they will continue to do so in the future. Times change however--variables change--and those who survive and thrive embrace a philosophy of adaptation; the others face certain extinction. Unfortunately these old methods and perspectives are well-entrenched within the scientific and medical community--thus yielding few results in regards to behavioral science. Evidence of this failed perspective is responsible for major gaps in man's advancement. For example, it is embarrassing to comprehend that mankind has the resources and ingenuity to walk on the moon, but still cannot draw up a simple developmental and behavioral model for depression or panic disorder. In response to this failure, the scientific community runs to the shelter of alienating neurobiological terminology in order to subjugate the public into submission. This is not an effective approach to say the least.
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						So now you may be saying to yourself something like, "Okay Douglas, I see your enthusiasm about this breakthrough theory of yours, but really---no disorders being solved without The Theorem and all being solved with, isn't that going a little too far?" I wish it were, let's take a look:
					</p>
					<p class="px-5 emphasis">
						The Problem of Autism
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						Autism is a perfect example of this failure. No matter how much money--millions into billions--you throw at the disorder you are never going to solve the mystery of autism, and most certainly never cure it. Why? Well, because there is an inherent flaw in research methodology. You cannot begin to understand autism until you understand typical human development and its overall purpose. And you cannot begin to understand the overall purpose of development until you understand Nature in relation to her goals within the human species. Now the number one goal, beyond delivering the fetus out of the womb, is reproduction. Everything and anything that is programmed into the fetal brain during development is focused on reproductional motivation. Only then, after understanding this, can you begin to compare, contrast and view with clarity as to what autism is and what it is not. To conceptualize this degree of 'out of the box' critical thinking is so far beyond the scope of researchers and scientist working the problem that it is unfathomable, as it simply does not exist. In short, you have to learn to perceive the problem from the top down---with omniscience that parallels Nature. This is what The Theorem provides, thus solving the puzzle on the macrocosm, which allows for gifted researchers to pinpoint the irregularities of autism on the microcosm. This will lead to a windfall of understanding, new insight and ultimately prevention, and or a 'cure' for this developmental disorder.
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						In contrast, from the bottom of the equation up---autism looks like just a series of unrelated symptoms and neural abnormalities. This generates one false hypothesis after another. Each of these hypotheses is forwarded by some of the most well-intentioned and highly decorated neural researchers the scientific community has to offer. These false hypothesis take years to disprove, but they are always disproven. This is an impossible perspective and inappropriate vantage point to expect results from. All the while the epidemic of autism grows and modifies; all the while parents suffer--it is tragic, really. The Theorem however changes all of this, as it flips the entire equation upside down (much like you did in the business world!). It will teach our best and brightest to think critically about the model included and from that perspective lead to a reinterpretation of the established research. All the research is already in place to solve the puzzle of autism--it has been for twenty years. This is how I validated my initial hypothesis in the first place, as The Theorem is built completely on neurobiological evidence.
					</p>
					<p class="px-5 emphasis">
						You want to help!! You are a leader!!!
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						However, do not get me wrong, there are researchers out there right now who have read The Theorem and they are accomplishing breakthrough work in autism and other disorders. But not enough of them have done this. And because one model to so many disorders and behaviors is contrary and revolutionary to the specialized methodology that they have been taught, they are afraid to speak out. At this point they would be laughed at and banished from the scientific community. It would be seen as treasonous, though--in the end their actions would be justified as absolutely correct. Does this sound familiar to anything you have experienced in the business community? If my inferences are right, you have! You are results driven and that is why I seek your help! Why debate and argue over a system that is broken? It is only throwing good money after bad. Just scrap the old methods and focus all those energies on finding a solution. I know this is what you do, and this is what The Theorem does as well!
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						To change public perception though is a grueling and often slow process. This of course is where you can help. I will be direct to you because I know you are a serious man-----your money and your vision will help! Marketing and promotion changes the public perception quickly. You would not think of investing in R&D without also having the finances to launch your new innovation to the public--yet this is what I was forced to do and the results were expectantly disappointing. What I am seeking is a financial endorsement of between one hundred thousand dollars (100,000) and four hundred thousand (400,000) US, to market this discovery properly and to cover basic living expenses as this unfolds. It would obviously be your choice as to what method; stipulations, if any, you wanted to impose on these monies. The terms and conditions can be as infinite as your imagination. These monies could be in the form of a gift or charitable contribution; I have set up TheTheorem.org for this purpose. It could be as a grant. The monies could be allocated in increments or as a lump sum. In the end though, these are nothing more than exotic terms for help. I have shouldered this massive discovery for close to 20 years and am running out of resources and could use a helping hand to continue--man to man.
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						You can stand behind your financial endorsement, or if you feel the discovery is perceived as too radical at the moment you could donate or invest anonymously. Later, when the Theorem breaks wide open into mainstream consciousness--you could step forward and gain the recognition and adulation you will rightly deserve! Discretion is a devotion to me. I would even consider allocating a percentage of ownership to the rights of this book as well. I currently hold an 85 percent stake in it--free and clear. I could also provide a budget if you feel that is helpful. Make no mistake about it however all monies will be used to market the book and for basic survival; I live very inexpensively. While I am not one tenth as frugal or wise with my money as you are, I am certainly not a stereotypical artist that is constantly leaking cash as they walk either. I raised two sons, predominately on my own, and am thrift driven. My only goal here is to get this discovery out to the most people possible, as long as it is in lines with the capitalist ideals I admire. I have a devoted and great team behind me, web people who are some of the best money can buy--yet they work for free because they believe in this discovery. I have a dedicated staff, but we are severely underfunded. We need the help of not just any man--but of a great man like you. Let there be no confusion, you can also simply click the donate button and change the world forever. I envy your position and opportunity, because perhaps never before in history has one man been as powerful as you are right now--- to have the intellectual destiny of mankind at his fingertips. Click the button and light will penetrate the darkness of disorders and ignorance forever. The historical cost benefit analysis is severely tilted--in your favor.
					</p>
					<p class="px-5">
						There will be a day, and it is coming, when this discovery will be taught from elementary school to and through college levels. A new generation will reach potentials only imagined decades ago and they will live in a world vacant of many of the disorders we see as permanent today. Best of all--this will all be made possible by you. And it will be your name that rolls off the tongue of billions as you set the standards for this new genre of visionary philanthropy!

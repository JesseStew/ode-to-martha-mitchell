					Note: This is a chronology of events loosely related to the six days of interviews. This is not a summary or a condensation of events. Attempting to interpret events out of this timeline, without the aid of the interview, will be not only confusing, but also counterproductive. This timeline therefore is only intended to give the readers of the interviews a point of reference should they become lost in the timeframe of the text, nothing more. Thank You.
